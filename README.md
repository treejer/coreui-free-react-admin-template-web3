CoreUI Web3 React Admin Template
This project is a web3 version of the CoreUI React admin template. It is a fork of the CoreUI admin template built with React.

Overview
We have extended the functionality of the original CoreUI template by adding web3 capabilities using the following libraries:

Wagmi: For connecting to wallets and interacting with blockchains.
Redux: For state management.
Redux Saga: For managing side effects, such as fetching blockchain data.
The CoreUI template already utilizes React and Bootstrap to provide a robust admin template with a wide range of UI components.

Quick Start
To get started with the project:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/treejer/coreui-free-react-admin-template-web3
Install dependencies: npm install
Start the development server: npm run start
The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

For more details on usage and customization, please refer to the CoreUI documentation.
