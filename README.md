# CoreUI Web3 React Admin Template
This project is a web3 version of the CoreUI React admin template. It is a fork of the CoreUI admin template built with React.

Overview
We have extended the functionality of the original CoreUI template by adding web3 capabilities using the following libraries:

- Wagmi - For connecting to wallets and interacting with blockchains.
- Redux - For state management.
- Redux Saga - For managing side effects, such as fetching blockchain data.

The CoreUI template already utilizes React and Bootstrap to provide a robust admin template with a wide range of UI components.
